<h1 align="center" id="title">Community Health Worker Support System</h1>

<p id="description">This software system will serve as a comprehensive Community Health Worker Support System (CHWSS) website designed to address critical healthcare challenges faced by pregnant women and community health workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The system's primary objective is to provide pregnant women with essential healthcare information and skills necessary during pregnancy and nursing periods and also provide a seamless way for pregnant women to report about their pregnancy so that health workers can start following up early. It will also enable community health workers to effectively communicate with their target communities online especially in situations where personal visits are restricted due to security concerns. Additionally the system will facilitate reporting mechanisms for community health workers to submit their work progress to supervisors allowing for efficient tracking and analysis.</p>
